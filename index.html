				<p> <strong>Self-Research</strong> </p>
					<p>After looking myself up for a little bit, I started to understand what it means to post things online. I found a radaris.com link with a
					picture I took of myself during sophomore year of high school and tried to find a way to remove it.  You can’t see my face in it so it’s
					okay, but I couldn’t get it removed with the options that I had, so I’m leaving it alone. I’ve known for a while about not posting things
					about myself that I wouldn’t like to see again, so this was new to me. I know even better now to make better decisions about posting things online. </p>

		<p><strong>Stove-Top</strong></p>
		<p><em>Front Burners</em></p>
		<p>I’m going to make my social media presence stronger, by promoting what I’m doing to make myself better, talking about what’s going on around me as far as
			the tech industry, and by linking with people who do the same.</p>
		<p>I’m going to make my github activity consistent.</p>
		<p><em>Back Burners</em></p>
		<p>I’m going to be more composed when I talk so that people understand me. I can do this by giving myself time to talk and for others to hear what I said.</p>
		<p>I’m going to be aware of due dates and managing my time well.</p>
		<p><em>Value Questions</em></p>
		<p>I’ve been told that I do have drive before and I do believe it. I feel like everyone has potential, its just unlocking it or seeking it that’s the hard part. I believe
			it because there more than what’s going on right now that I need to experience.</p>
		<p>Internal factors blocking me are self-doubt. Can I actually do this? External Factors are financial and time.</p>
		<p>I create value for others by not wasting peoples time, by helping as much as I can, and by being honest to lessen doubt. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
			<p>Working for Seven Clover, my beginning production rate was about 300 units of packaged product a day. Within a few weeks I was producing around 1000 units of packaged product per day. </p>
			<p>I helped increase efficiency at Seven Clover by helping to create better systems to reduce errors. Errors went down from 3 a work day to about one a week</p>
			<p>My longest place of work was five years.</p>
			<br>
		<h3>Qualitative Accomplishments</h3>
			<p>I'm empathetic and sensitive. I can relate with people and understand them, but this also affects me, sometimes personally.</p>
			<p>I'm critical of myself. I don't like letting myself go unchecked, but I can also be too hard on myself. </p>
			<p>I'm quiet. I listen well, but I don't speak my opinion as often as I feel I should.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<p>Why: Building stronger communities </p>
			<p>How: I'm enrolled in Deep Dive Coding learning how to write many programming languages.</p>
			<p>What: I'm learning to program.</p>
			<br>
		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p> <strong>Version One:</strong> </p>
			<p>Hi, I'm Carlos. I love and value the local community and want to see it grow. I'm currently learning how to write code in html, css, and php. Do you know of any way we can help?</p>
			<p> <strong>Version Two:</strong> </p>
			<p>Hi! I'm Carlos. I'm learning to program to build a stronger community. I'm currently enrolled in Deep Dive Coding learning how to write html, css, and js. Could we have a moment to talk?</p>
			<br>
		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p> <strong>Week 1</strong> </p>
			<p>It's been a good week. I'm making good friends and stronger connections with what I'm working with. I feel like this camp's going to be hard but I can do it.</p>
			<p> <strong>Week 2</strong> </p>
			<p>Week 2 went by quick! I went to a few events; an angular meetup, a party/recruiting event, and a
			techhire hiring event. I'm starting to learn what I like and do like in the industry, and what areas of it
			that I would like to work in. In class, we're learning object oriented with a little bit of user-interface/user-experience.
			I'm grasping it for the most part, but I was warned that the feeling would end soon so I'm trying to brace for it. </p>
			<p><strong>Week 3</strong></p>
			<p>Looking at week three and thinking about it kind of stresses me out if I'm being honest. It seems to be going faster and the topics are piling on, but that's okay.
			I struggled a little bit this week compared to the others. I'm going to stay focused though and continue to push.</p>
