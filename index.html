		<p> Kinesthetic 30 %</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>

					<li>My longest place of work was five years.</li>
				</ul>
		<br>
				<h3>Qualitative Accomplishments</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm empathetic and sensitive. I can relate with people and understand them, but this also affects me, sometimes personally.</li>
					<li>I'm critical of myself. I don't like letting myself go unchecked, but I can also be too hard on myself. </li>
					<li>I'm quiet. I listen well, but I don't speak my opinion as often as I feel I should.</li>
				</ul>
		<br>
				<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Why: Building stronger communities </li>
					<li>How: I'm enrolled in Deep Dive Coding learning how to write many programming languages.</li>

				<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Version One:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Hi! My name is Carlos. I program websites to save lives. I'm in a coding bootcamp that teaches me how to write in html, js, and php. Have you thought about how to save the world today?</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Version Two:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Hi! I'm Carlos. I'm learning to program to build a stronger community. I'm currently enrolled in Deep Dive Coding learning how to write html, css, and js. Could we have a moment to talk?</p>
		<br>
			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Week 1</strong>
			</p>
			<p>It's been a good week. I'm making good friends and stronger connections with what I'm working with. I feel like this camp's going to be hard but I can do it.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Week 2</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Week 2 went by quick! I went to a few events; an angular meetup, a party/recruiting event, and a
			techhire hiring event. I'm starting to learn what I like and do like in the industry, and what areas of it
			that I would like to work in. In class, we're learning object oriented with a little bit of user-interface/user-experience.
			I'm grasping it for the most part, but I was warned that the feeling would end soon so I'm trying to brace for it.
